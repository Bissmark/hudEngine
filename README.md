## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] Add in the different scene and game view, scene view allowing scaling, rotating and transforming
- [ ] Add in an ECS system for my gameObjects
- [ ] Link my project tab to the different files in that folder
- [ ] Allow different scripts, materials and such to be added to gameObjects

Thats it for now, from there then I can start thinking about what else I want to add, I would love to create a game one day with this engine, I will be very proud of myself if I can do that
